The data, namelists, and scripts in this file are for reproducing the results in
Vogl et al. "Improving time-step convergence in an atmosphere model with simple
physics: a sub-grid reconstruction framework for alternative closure with
numerical robustness" (submitted to JAMES).

The namelists directory contains E3SM (ACME) namelists that can be used to generate
the convergence test output used in Vogl et al. (2019).

The scripts in this directory with a "calc" prefix can be used to post-process
the output generated by the namelists above, storing the results in the data
folder.

As a convenience to the reader, the data folder is pre-populated with
post-processed results for the convergence tests.

The scripts in this directory with a "plot" prefix can be used to generate the
plots in Vogl et al. "Improving time-step convergence in an atmosphere model 
with simple physics: a sub-grid reconstruction framework for alternative 
closure with numerical robustness" (submitted to JAMES).  The convergence test
plots will use the post-processed results in the data directory.
