The data, namelists, and scripts in this file are for reproducing the results in
Vogl et al. Evaluation of Implicit-Explicit Additive Runge-Kutta Integrators for
the HOMME-NH Dynamical Core. 2019 (preprint).

The namelists directory contains HOMME-NH namelists that can be used to generate
the output used in Vogl et al. (2019).

The scripts in this directory with a "calc" prefix can be used to post-process
the output generated by the namelists above, storing the results in the data
folder.

As a convenience to the reader, the data folder is pre-populated with
post-processed results.

The scripts in this directory with a "plot" prefix can be used to generate the
plots in Vogl et al. (2019) from the results in the data directory.
